# Payroll-Tracker
A website that tracks a number of employees, then randomly draws a winner.
When you click the "Add employee" button
Then you are presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
When you finish adding an employee
Then you are prompted to continue or cancel
When you choose to continue
Then you are prompted to add a new employee
When you choose to cancel
Then your employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
